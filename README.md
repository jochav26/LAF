This project contains the code for a fully automated maskless laser lithography machine. It has four main functions; filter selection, shutter control, xy-stage control, and laser auto focus. Filter selection, shutter control and laser auto focus all use Arduino, servo and stepper motors and so this code will be blocked together. Because the three will operate on one Arduino board, we will create a code that has switch cases.
